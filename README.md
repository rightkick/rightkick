- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex
- 👀 I’m interested in open source technologies and although I find it hard to limit my curiosity to a specific category of tech I mostly enjoy grapling with infrastructure and networking challenges or I guess you can say devopsy things. 
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge on distributed systems, observability and data instensive applications. 
- 💞️ I enjoy also reading books, percussions and have been practicing Tai Chi, which I always find it quite fullfilling. 
- 📫 How to reach me: you can email me at `rightkicktech <at> gmail <dot> com`
